  Scenario: Get list of security servers
    Given Authentication header is set to MANAGEMENT_SERVICE
    And member class 'TEST' is created
    And new member 'CS:TEST:member-1' is added
    And new security server 'CS:TEST:member-1:SS-X' authentication certificate registered with origin 'SECURITY_SERVER'

  Scenario Outline: Security servers list sorting
    Given Authentication header is set to MANAGEMENT_SERVICE
    And member class 'TEST' is created
    And member class 'ANOTHER' is created
    And new member 'CS:TEST:member-1' is added
    And new member 'CS:ANOTHER:member-2' is added
    And new security server 'CS:TEST:member-1:SS-X' authentication certificate registered with origin 'SECURITY_SERVER'

    And new security server 'CS:ANOTHER:member-2:SS-A' authentication certificate registered with origin 'SECURITY_SERVER'
    And management request is approved
    And Authentication header is set to SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATOR
    When user requests security servers list sorted by '<$sortField>' '<$sortDirection>'
    Then the list is sorted by '<$responseFieldExpression>' '<$sortDirection>'
    Examples:
      | $sortField            | $sortDirection | $responseFieldExpression |
      | xroad_id.server_code  | desc           | xroadId.serverCode       |
